A [GNOME extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1217/appfolders-manager/) allowing easy management of "appfolders" directly from the applications view. As a bonus feature, it is possible to change the number of columns.

### Current version
Features :
* Create new appfolders (with a dialog entry)
* Add applications to folders (submenu)
* Remove applications from folders (submenu)
* Delete appfolders (submenu) ; optionnally, a total deletion
* Set the maximum number of columns (GNOME Shell's default is 6)

### Installation
Install it from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1217/appfolders-manager/

This version is not perfect, I'm aware of most bugs (see what i write in [that issue](https://github.com/Maestroschan/appfolders-manager-gnome-extension/issues/2) which i often edit).

Manual installation :
* Download the .zip archive and extract files in `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/appfolders-manager@maestroschan.fr`
* Restart Gnome Shell.
* Activate the extension.

### Future versions
* Right-click on an appfolder to delete or rename it
* Drag and drop (i hope)
